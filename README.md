# User Stories:

1-As a user, I would like to be able view a huge library of pieces of art, so we used an pre-existing art api where we can get arts from.

2-As a user, I would like to be able to add whatever art I like to my favorites collection, so that we added a favorite button included in art cards.

3-As a user, I would like to be able to post my own pieces of art, so that we made a page dedicated to that, where you can post your own arts using a form.

4-As a user, I would like to be able to see my own posted pieces of art, so that we made whatever the user posts gets rendered in that same page.

5-As a user, I would like to be able to read about developers and their vision, so that we made an about us page where you can just do that!
